            <p> My favorite hobby is Crafting.I am 12 years old and I read in class 6th. I like to make something different like wall hanger,photoframe,earings,etc...... with papers,glue,scissors,etc...... Its too fun to do craftings.Crafting is very enjoyable for me because I make things that I can be proud of. Also, you can have fun by thinking of what to make and while you are making it.I love to do crafts.

            <p> "They dance with me so that I can dance and take my hobby forward. I never dance in the same style but I like to mix up everything. I know many types of dancing such as Jaz, tap, modern, hip hop, swing and western. ... When I dance in the parties nobody can stop me from moving my feet fast in the rhythm of the music.Children who learn dance as a hobby have shown convincing improvement in their concentration, physical fitness and flexibility, self control, patience and confidence level. Dancing teaches them how to relax by overcoming their depressions and stresses. Children can also lose their excess flab through dancing. It also provides them with a perfect platform to socialize and meet different people.

                Dance is also one of the most lucrative career options for children. Proficient dancers will always manage to find vacancies as a choreographer or a dance teacher in myriads of dance classes, health and entertainment institutions.

                Dancing is completely an exciting and fulfilling hobby. All the related elements of dance such as rhythm and movement, music, atmosphere, partnerships and togetherness confer a wonderful experience to the dancers. Very few other hobbies are as useful and rewarding as dancing. It is for these reasons parents tend to always encourage their children to pursue dance as a hobby.."> </p>

            <p>My first favorite hobby is making crafts. I don't just do crafts whenever I am bored, I do them whenever I feel like it. I do different types of things like pots, fake flowers, pillows, and whatever I think it's cute and that matches with my room. The reason I do this is because I like to do art, not like drawing but crafts. My mom and my sister kind of inspired me to do this because they were always creative with all kinds of stuff. My sister was creative with drawing and decorating stuff (she was kind of fashionable). My mom was always creative in everything; she even helped with both of my sisters to decorate a little bit more on my both sister’s quinceañeras. I love it. </p>
